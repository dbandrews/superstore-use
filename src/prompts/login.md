   (this indicates a saved login), simply click on that email to proceed.
   Then wait patiently for the login to complete - this may take several seconds.

   a. Click on the email/username input field to focus it
   b. Use the type_email tool to enter the email: {username}

These tools type with human-like delays to avoid bot detection.
